# NNLibrary
PROJECT 3 - Neural Network Library

 

For this project you are to develop a neural network library (in Java or C++, C#, Python). The library should allow for easily adding new modules, as well as easily be used. Proof that the algorithms work must be shown (by comparing to known results for benchmark problems). Your library should include:

 

FFNN:

- vanilla BP w/momentum

- quickProp

- rProp

-Delta- bar

- cascade correlation

- conjugate gradient (pick 1 method, but allow for others)

- levenberg-marquardt

- easily adapt these if the error function changes

 

Variations of Generalization Techniques:

- cross-validation (a few techniques, as well as some bootstrapping)

- early stopping

- jitter

- pruning/growing

- input/output rescaling

- various statistical measures (correlation, etc) to analyse input data

- different weight initialization methods

- different activation functions

- different error functions

- weight decay

- bootstrapping

 

Kohonen Feature Maps

- as well as different cluster validation and distance measures

- a tool that plots the feature map (if requested by the user)

 

Note that the user should be allowed to easily alter any parameters or functions that these techniques require. You are to hand in a user manual describing how to use and update the library. Example applications should also be included with the library (simple ones). Additionally, you are to add a library design specification detailing the design of the library (i.e. a UML class diagram). The code must be very well documented and compared to known results to ensure it is properly working. Ensure that all object-oriented rules are correctly followed!
